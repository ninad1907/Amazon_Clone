# Amazon_Clone
I spearheaded a project to create a clone of the Amazon home page using HTML and CSS, showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development. I replicated the layout, design elements of the original Amazon home page.The project allowed me to develop a deep understanding of web design principles to master the latest technologies in web development.
