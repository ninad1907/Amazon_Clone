# Amazon_Clone
I spearheaded an ambitious project to create a clone of the Amazon home page using HTML and CSS, showcasing my proficiency in front-end web development. 
Leveraging my skills in crafting responsive and visually appealing user interfaces, I meticulously replicated the layout, design elements, and interactive features of the original Amazon home page.
The project allowed me to hone my coding skills, develop a deep understanding of web design principles, and showcased my commitment to mastering the latest technologies in the ever-evolving field of web development.
